# `option`), and `super` (alias: `cmd`, `command`). You may use the modifier
# or the alias. When debugging keybinds, the non-aliased modifier will always
# be used in output.
#
# Action is the action to take when the trigger is satisfied. It takes the
# format `action` or `action:param`. The latter form is only valid if the
# action requires a parameter.
#
#   * `ignore` - Do nothing, ignore the key input. This can be used to
#     black hole certain inputs to have no effect.
#
#   * `unbind` - Remove the binding. This makes it so the previous action
#     is removed, and the key will be sent through to the child command
#     if it is printable.
#
#   * `csi:text` - Send a CSI sequence. i.e. `csi:A` sends "cursor up".
#     See: https://aperiodic.net/pip/archives/Geekery/term-function-keys/
#
#   * `esc:text` - Send an escape sequence. i.e. `esc:d` deletes to the
#     end of the word to the right.
#
#   * `text:text` - Send a string. Uses Zig string literal syntax.
#     i.e. `text:\x15` sends Ctrl-U.
#
# Some notes for the action:
#
#   * The parameter is taken as-is after the `:`. Double quotes or
#     other mechanisms are included and NOT parsed. If you want to
#     send a string value that includes spaces, wrap the entire

# be scaled appropriately for screen DPI.
#
# If this value is set too large, the screen will render nothing, because the
# grid will be completely squished by the padding. It is up to you as the user

# one side. If this is `false`, the top left grid cell will always hug the
# edge with zero padding other than what may be specified with the other
# `window-padding` options.
#
# If other `window-padding` fields are set and this is `true`, this will still

# The "native" style uses the native macOS titlebar with zero customization.
# The titlebar will match your window theme (see `window-theme`).
#
# The "transparent" style is the same as "native" but the titlebar will
# be transparent and allow your window background color to come through.
# This makes a more seamless window appearance but looks a little less
# typical for a macOS application and may not work well with all themes.
#
# The "tabs" style is a completely custom titlebar that integrates the
# tab bar into the titlebar. This titlebar always matches the background
# color of the terminal. There are some limitations to this style:
# On macOS 13 and below, saved window state will not restore tabs correctly.
# macOS 14 does not have this issue and any other macOS version has not
# been tested.
#
# The default value is "transparent". This is an opinionated choice
# but its one I think is the most aesthetically pleasing and works in
# most cases.
#
# Changing this option at runtime only applies to new windows.

# If `true`, the *Option* key will be treated as *Alt*. This makes terminal
# sequences expecting *Alt* to work properly, but will break Unicode input
# sequences on macOS if you use them via the *Alt* key. You may set this to
# `false` to restore the macOS *Alt* key unicode sequences but this will break
# terminal sequences expecting *Alt* to work.
#
# Note that if an *Option*-sequence doesn't produce a printable character, it
# will be treated as *Alt* regardless of this setting. (i.e. `alt+ctrl+a`).

# Put every surface (tab, split, window) into a dedicated Linux cgroup.
#
# This makes it so that resource management can be done on a per-surface
# granularity. For example, if a shell program is using too much memory,
# only that shell will be killed by the oom monitor instead of the entire
# Ghostty process. Similarly, if a shell program is using too much CPU,
# only that surface will be CPU-throttled.
#
# This will cause startup times to be slower (a hundred milliseconds or so),
# so the default value is "single-instance." In single-instance mode, only
# one instance of Ghostty is running (see gtk-single-instance) so the startup
# time is a one-time cost. Additionally, single instance Ghostty is much
# more likely to have many windows, tabs, etc. so cgroup isolation is a
# big benefit.
#
# This feature requires systemd. If systemd is unavailable, cgroup
# initialization will fail. By default, this will not prevent Ghostty
# from working (see linux-cgroup-hard-fail).
#
# Valid values are:
#
#   * `never` - Never use cgroups.
#   * `always` - Always use cgroups.
#   * `single-instance` - Enable cgroups only for Ghostty instances launched
#     as single-instance applications (see gtk-single-instance).

# will be allowed to fail and the failure is ignored. This is useful if
# you view cgroup isolation as a "nice to have" and not a critical resource
# management feature, because Ghostty startup will not fail if cgroup APIs
# fail.
#
# If this is true, then any cgroup initialization failure will cause
# Ghostty to exit or new surfaces to not be created.

# If `true` (default), Ghostty will enable libadwaita theme support. This
